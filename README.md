# Image_Augmentation
Project Completed: Image Augmentation using Affine Transformations 
I'm excited to share my latest project on Image Augmentation using Affine Transformation techniques, developed as part of my hands-on learning in Computer Vision! 
 What is Image Augmentation?
 Image augmentation is the process of artificially increasing the size and diversity of an image dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, translation, and more. This technique is vital for improving model accuracy, generalization, and performance—especially in scenarios with limited or imbalanced datasets.
 Why Use Image Augmentation?
Reduces the need for large, costly datasets
Helps balance class distribution by generating more samples
Simulates real-world distortions and variations
Improves model robustness and prevents overfitting
 Geometric (Affine) Transformations Applied:
  Translation – Shifted images along X and Y axes
  Rotation – Rotated images by custom angles
  Shearing – Skewed image axes for distortion
  Cropping – Removed portions to focus on regions of interest
  Scaling – Resized images while preserving proportions

 Tools & Libraries Used:
 Python | OpenCV | NumPy | Pandas | Streamlit
